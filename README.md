# Blog

I'm really glad to tell you that you reached the next phase, per our conversation here's the task we've told you about.
We want you to build a simple blogging system using Laravel framework and MySQL as DB storage.
Requirements:
1. Only the admin can add articles.
2. Admin should assign a category to each article they add.
3. Visitors can list the published articles.
4. Visitors can add comments on the published articles.
5. Visitors can filter articles by category.
6. Deploy your code on whatever GIT platform you like and share the link with us, (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab)
7. In the README file please provide in steps how to build the project and make it up and running.
Feel free to use your preferred Frontend framework you like (Vue or Angular for example) or you can normally use blade views to build your frontend. Whatever you are used to and comfortable with, also feel free to use bootstrap or even foundation to build the frontend or even a ready-made template you like and you can use one of these themes:

A small hint, we are not trying to measure your problem-solving skills here as you may notice the task is very straightforward and simple, I already touched your problem-solving capabilities in the interview, we need to measure how far your code quality in a small project can go, make sure you deliver a high-end code quality.
Note: Regarding the Back-End try not to use ready-made packages, we would like to see your own best code.
Please Confirm Receiving this email.
Best Regards,
